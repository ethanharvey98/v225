title: 'LymphoML: An interpretable artificial intelligence-based method identifies
  morphologic features that correlate with lymphoma subtype'
abstract: 'The accurate classification of lymphoma subtypes using hematoxylin and
  eosin (H {\}& E)-stained tissue is complicated by the wide range of morphological
  features these cancers can exhibit. We present LymphoML - an interpretable machine
  learning method that identifies morphologic features that correlate with lymphoma
  subtypes. Our method applies steps to process H {\}& E-stained tissue microarray
  cores, segment nuclei and cells, compute features encompassing morphology, texture,
  and architecture, and train gradient-boosted models to make diagnostic predictions.
  LymphoML{â€™}s interpretable models, developed on a limited volume of H {\}& E-stained
  tissue, achieve non-inferior diagnostic accuracy to pathologists using whole-slide
  images and outperform black box deep-learning on a dataset of 670 cases from Guatemala
  spanning 8 lymphoma subtypes. Using SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) analysis,
  we assess the impact of each feature on model prediction and find that nuclear shape
  features are most discriminative for DLBCL (F1-score: 78.7 {\}% ) and classical
  Hodgkin lymphoma (F1-score: 74.5 {\}% ). Finally, we provide the first demonstration
  that a model combining features from H {\}& E-stained tissue with features from
  a standardized panel of 6 immunostains results in a similar diagnostic accuracy
  (85.3 {\}% ) to a 46-stain panel (86.1 {\}% ).'
