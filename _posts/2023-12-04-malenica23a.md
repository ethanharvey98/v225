title: Anytime-valid inference in N-of-1 trials
abstract: App-based N-of-1 trials offer a scalable experimental design for assessing
  the effects of health interventions at an individual level. Their practical success
  depends on the strong motivation of participants, which, in turn, translates into
  high adherence and reduced loss to follow-up. One way to maintain participant engagement
  is by sharing their interim results. Continuously testing hypotheses during a trial,
  known as “peeking”, can also lead to shorter, lower-risk trials by detecting strong
  effects early. Nevertheless, traditionally, results are only presented upon the
  trial’s conclusion. In this work, we introduce a potential outcomes framework that
  permits interim peeking of the results and enables statistically valid inferences
  to be drawn at any point during N-of-1 trials. Our work builds on the growing literature
  on valid confidence sequences , which enables anytime-valid inference with uniform
  type-1 error guarantees over time. We propose several causal estimands for treatment
  effects applicable in an N-of-1 trial and demonstrate, through empirical evaluation,
  that the proposed approach results in valid confidence sequences over time. We anticipate
  that incorporating anytime-valid inference into clinical trials can significantly
  enhance trial participation and empower participants.
