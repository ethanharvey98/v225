title: LLMs Accelerate Annotation for Medical Information Extraction
abstract: The unstructured nature of clinical notes within electronic health records
  often conceals vital patient-related information, making it challenging to access
  or interpret. To uncover this hidden information, specialized Natural Language Processing
  (NLP) models are required. However, training these models necessitates large amounts
  of labeled data, a process that is both time-consuming and costly when relying solely
  on human experts for annotation. In this paper, we propose an approach that combines
  Large Language Models (LLMs) with human expertise to create an efficient method
  for generating ground truth labels for medical text annotation. By utilizing LLMs
  in conjunction with human annotators, we significantly reduce the human annotation
  burden, enabling the rapid creation of labeled datasets. We rigorously evaluate
  our method on a medical information extraction task, demonstrating that our approach
  not only substantially cuts down on human intervention but also maintains high accuracy.
  The results highlight the potential of using LLMs to improve the utilization of
  unstructured clinical data, allowing for the swift deployment of tailored NLP solutions
  in healthcare.
