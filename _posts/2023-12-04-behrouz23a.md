title: Learning Temporal Higher-order Patterns to Detect Anomalous Brain Activity
abstract: 'Due to recent advances in machine learning on graphs, representing the
  connections of the human brain as a network has become one of the most pervasive
  analytical paradigms. However, most existing graph machine learning-based methods
  suffer from a subset of five critical limitations: They are (1) designed for simple
  pair-wise interactions while recent studies on the human brain show the existence
  of higher-order dependencies of brain regions, (2) designed to perform on pre-constructed
  networks from time-series data, which limits their generalizability, (3) designed
  for classifying brain networks, limiting their ability to reveal underlying patterns
  that might cause the symptoms of a disease or disorder, (4) designed for learning
  of static patterns, missing the dynamics of human brain activity, and (5) designed
  in supervised setting, relying their performance on the existence of labeled data.
  To address these limitations, we present , an end-to-end anomaly detection model
  that automatically learns the structure of the hypergraph representation of the
  brain from neuroimage data. uses a tetra-stage message-passing mechanism along with
  an attention mechanism that learns the importance of higher-order dependencies of
  brain regions. We further present a new adaptive hypergraph pooling to obtain brain-level
  representation, enabling to detect the neuroimage of people living with a specific
  disease or disorder. Our experiments on Parkinson{â€™}s Disease, Attention Deficit
  Hyperactivity Disorder, and Autism Spectrum Disorder show the efficiency and effectiveness
  of our approaches in detecting anomalous brain activity.'
