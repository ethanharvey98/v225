title: 'Med-Flamingo: a Multimodal Medical Few-shot Learner'
abstract: Medicine, by its nature, is a multifaceted domain that requires the synthesis
  of information across various modalities. Medical generative vision-language models{~}(VLMs)
  make a first step in this direction and promise many exciting clinical applications.
  However, existing models typically have to be fine-tuned on sizeable down-stream
  datasets, which poses a significant limitation as in many medical applications data
  is scarce, necessitating models that are capable of learning from few examples in
  real-time. Here we propose Med-Flamingo, a multimodal few-shot learner adapted to
  the medical domain. Based on OpenFlamingo-9B, we continue pre-training on paired
  and interleaved medical image-text data from publications and textbooks. Med-Flamingo
  unlocks few-shot generative medical visual question answering{~}(VQA) abilities,
  which we evaluate on several datasets including a novel challenging open-ended VQA
  dataset of visual USMLE-style problems. Furthermore, we conduct the first human
  evaluation for generative medical VQA where physicians review the problems and blinded
  generations in an interactive app. Med-Flamingo improves performance in generative
  medical VQA by up to 20 {\}% in clinicianâ€™s rating and firstly enables multimodal
  medical few-shot adaptations, such as rationale generation. We release our model,
  code, and evaluation app. %under{~}{\}url\{https://github.com/snap-stanford/med-flamingo\}.
