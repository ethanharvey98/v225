title: Multimodal Pretraining of Medical Time Series and Notes
abstract: Within the intensive care unit (ICU), a wealth of patient data, including
  clinical measurements and clinical notes, is readily available. This data is a valuable
  resource for comprehending patient health and informing medical decisions, but it
  also contains many challenges in analysis. Deep learning models show promise in
  extracting meaningful patterns, but they require extensive labeled data, a challenge
  in critical care. To address this, we propose a novel approach employing self-supervised
  pretraining, focusing on the alignment of clinical measurements and notes. Our approach
  combines contrastive and masked token prediction tasks during pretraining. Semi-supervised
  experiments on the MIMIC-III dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our self-supervised
  pretraining. In downstream tasks, including in-hospital mortality prediction and
  phenotyping, our pretrained model outperforms baselines in settings where only a
  fraction of the data is labeled, emphasizing its ability to enhance ICU data analysis.
  Notably, our method excels in situations where very few labels are available, as
  evidenced by an increase in the AUC-ROC for in-hospital mortality by 0.17 and in
  AUC-PR for phenotyping by 0.1 when only 1 {\}% of labels are accessible. This work
  advances self-supervised learning in the healthcare domain, optimizing clinical
  insights from abundant yet challenging ICU data.
