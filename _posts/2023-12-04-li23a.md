title: Gradient-Map-Guided Adaptive Domain Generalization for Cross Modality MRI Segmentation
abstract: Cross-modal MRI segmentation is of great value for computer-aided medical
  diagnosis, enabling flexible data acquisition and model generalization. However,
  most existing methods have difficulty in handling local variations in domain shift
  and typically require a significant amount of data for training, which hinders their
  usage in practice. To address these problems, we propose a novel adaptive domain
  generalization framework, which integrates a learning-free cross-domain representation
  based on image gradient maps and a class prior-informed test-time adaptation strategy
  for mitigating local domain shift. We validate our approach on two multi-modal MRI
  datasets with six cross-modal segmentation tasks. Across all the task settings,
  our method consistently outperforms competing approaches and shows a stable performance
  even with limited training data. Our Codes are available now at https://github.com/cuttle-fish-my/GM-Guided-DG
