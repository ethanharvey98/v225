title: 'REMEDI: REinforcement learning-driven adaptive MEtabolism modeling of primary
  sclerosing cholangitis DIsease progression'
abstract: Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare disease wherein altered bile
  acid metabolism contributes to sustained liver injury. This paper introduces REMEDI,
  a framework that captures bile acid dynamics and the body’s adaptive response during
  PSC progression that can assist in exploring treatments. REMEDI merges a differential
  equation (DE)-based mechanistic model that describes bile acid metabolism with reinforcement
  learning (RL) to emulate the body’s adaptations to PSC continuously. An objective
  of adaptation is to maintain homeostasis by regulating enzymes involved in bile
  acid metabolism. These enzymes correspond to the parameters of the DEs. REMEDI leverages
  RL to approximate adaptations in PSC, treating homeostasis as a reward signal and
  the adjustment of the DE parameters as the corresponding actions. On real-world
  data, REMEDI generated bile acid dynamics and parameter adjustments consistent with
  published findings. Also, our results support discussions in the literature that
  early administration of drugs that suppress bile acid synthesis may be effective
  in PSC treatment.
