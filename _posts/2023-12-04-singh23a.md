title: 'Eigen: Expert-Informed Joint Learning Aggregation for High-Fidelity Information
  Extraction from Document Images'
abstract: Information Extraction (IE) from document images is challenging due to the
  high variability of layout formats. Deep models such as etc . In this work, we propose
  a novel approach, EIGEN (Expert-Informed Joint Learning aGgrEatioN), which combines
  rule-based methods with deep learning models using data programming approaches to
  circumvent the requirement of annotation of large amounts of training data. Specifically,
  consolidates weak labels induced from multiple heuristics through generative models
  and use them along with a small number of annotated labels to jointly train a deep
  model. In our framework, we propose the use of labeling functions that include incorporating
  contextual information thus capturing the visual and language context of a word
  for accurate categorization. We empirically show that our framework can significantly
  improve the performance of state-of-the-art deep models with the availability of
  very few labeled data instances Source code is available at https://github.com/ayushayush591/EIGEN-High-Fidelity-Extraction-Document-Images
