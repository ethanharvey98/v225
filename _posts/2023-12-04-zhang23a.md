title: Diffusion Model-Based Data Augmentation for Lung Ultrasound Classification
  with Limited Data
abstract: Deep learning models typically require large quantities of data for good
  generalization. However, acquiring labeled medical imaging data is expensive, particularly
  for rare pathologies. While standard data augmentation is routinely performed to
  improve data variety, it may not be sufficient to improve the performance of downstream
  tasks with a clinical diagnostic purpose. Here we investigate the applicability
  of SinDDM kulikov2023sinddm , a single-image denoising diffusion model, for medical
  image data augmentation with lung ultrasound (LUS) images. Qualitative and quantitative
  evaluation of perceptual quality of the generated images were conducted. A multi-class
  classification task to detect various pathologies from LUS images was also employed
  to demonstrate the effectiveness of synthetic data augmentation using SinDDM. We
  further evaluated the image generation performance of FewDDM, an extended version
  of SinDDM trained on a limited number of images instead of a single image. Our results
  show that both SinDDM and FewDDM are able to generate images superior in quality
  compared to single-image generative adversarial networks (GANs), and are also highly
  effective in augmenting medical imaging data with limited number of samples to improve
  downstream task performance.
