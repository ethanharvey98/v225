title: Using Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Objective Cluster-Level Optimization
  of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions for Infectious Disease
abstract: 'In the early stages of an infectious disease crisis, non-pharmaceutical
  interventions (NPIs) such as quarantines and testing can play an important role.
  Optimizing the delivery of NPIs is challenging as they can impose substantial direct
  costs (e.g., test costs) and human impacts (e.g., quarantine of uninfected individuals)
  and can be especially difficult to target for infections that may spread pre- or
  asymptomatically. %and infections may spread pre- or asymptomatically, leading to
  a multi-objective, partially observable problem. In addition, superspreading, a
  common characteristic of many infectious diseases, induces informational dependencies
  across a cluster (group of individuals exposed by the same seed case). We formulate
  NPI optimization as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which
  we aim to solve with reinforcement learning (RL). We find RL provides a promising
  technical foundation that even modern approaches struggle. We propose a novel RL
  approach that leverages a supervised learning decoder as well as permutation invariant,
  fixed-size observation representations. Through extensive experimentation and evaluation,
  we show that our optimized policy can outperform all benchmarks by up to 27 {\}%
  . %Our model can achieve up 60{\}% and 77{\}% improvement compared with non-action
  policy and CDC policy, respectively. Additionally, we show that the policies discovered
  by RL can be distilled into decision trees to simplify deployment while still achieving
  strong performance. We publicly release our code and RL environments at: {~} https://github.com/XueqiaoPeng/Covid-RLSL'
