title: Mixture of Coupled HMMs for Robust Modeling of Multivariate Healthcare Time
  Series
abstract: 'Analysis of multivariate healthcare time series data is inherently challenging:
  irregular sampling, noisy and missing values, and heterogeneous patient groups with
  different dynamics violating exchangeability. In addition, interpretability and
  quantification of uncertainty are critically important. Here, we propose a novel
  class of models, a mixture of coupled hidden Markov models (M-CHMM), and demonstrate
  how it elegantly overcomes these challenges. To make the model learning feasible,
  we derive two algorithms to sample the sequences of the latent variables in the
  CHMM: samplers based on (i) particle filtering and (ii) factorized approximation.
  Compared to existing inference methods, our algorithms are computationally tractable,
  improve mixing, and allow for likelihood estimation, which is necessary to learn
  the mixture model. Experiments on challenging real-world epidemiological and semi-synthetic
  data demonstrate the advantages of the M-CHMM: improved data fit, capacity to efficiently
  handle missing and noisy measurements, improved prediction accuracy, and ability
  to identify interpretable subsets in the data.'
