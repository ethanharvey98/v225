title: Learning Generalized Medical Image Representations Through Image-Graph Contrastive
  Pretraining
abstract: Medical image interpretation using deep learning has shown promise but often
  requires extensive expert-annotated datasets. To reduce this annotation burden,
  we develop an Image-Graph Contrastive Learning framework that pairs chest X-rays
  with structured report knowledge graphs automatically extracted from radiology notes.
  Our approach uniquely encodes the disconnected graph components via a relational
  graph convolution network and transformer attention. In experiments on the CheXpert
  dataset, this novel graph encoding strategy enabled the framework to outperform
  existing methods that use image-text contrastive learning in 1 {\}% linear evaluation
  and few-shot settings, while achieving comparable performance to radiologists. By
  exploiting unlabeled paired images and text, our framework demonstrates the potential
  of structured clinical insights to enhance contrastive learning for medical images.
  This work points toward reducing demands on medical experts for annotations, improving
  diagnostic precision, and advancing patient care through robust medical image understanding.
