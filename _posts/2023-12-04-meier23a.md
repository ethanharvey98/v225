title: Designing and evaluating an online reinforcement learning agent for physical
  exercise recommendations in N-of-1 trials
abstract: Personalized adaptive interventions offer the opportunity to increase patient
  benefits, however, there are challenges in their planning and implementation. Once
  implemented, it is an important question whether personalized adaptive interventions
  are indeed clinically more effective compared to a fixed gold standard intervention.
  In this paper, we present an innovative N-of-1 trial study design testing whether
  implementing a personalized intervention by an online reinforcement learning agent
  is feasible and effective. Throughout, we use a new study on physical exercise recommendations
  to reduce pain in endometriosis for illustration. We describe the design of a contextual
  bandit recommendation agent and evaluate the agent in simulation studies. The results
  show that, first, implementing a personalized intervention by an online reinforcement
  learning agent is feasible. Second, such adaptive interventions have the potential
  to improve patientsâ€™ benefits even if only few observations are available. As one
  challenge, they add complexity to the design and implementation process. In order
  to quantify the expected benefit, data from previous interventional studies is required.
  We expect our approach to be transferable to other interventions and clinical interventions.
