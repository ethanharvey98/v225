title: 'TransEHR: Self-Supervised Transformer for Clinical Time Series Data'
abstract: 'Deep neural networks, including the Transformer architecture, have achieved
  remarkable performance in various time series tasks. However, their effectiveness
  in handling clinical time series data is hindered by specific challenges: 1) Sparse
  event sequences collected asynchronously with multivariate time series, and 2) Limited
  availability of labeled data. To address these challenges, we propose Our code is
  available at https://github.com/SigmaTsing/TransEHR.git . , a self-supervised Transformer
  model designed to encode multi-sourced asynchronous sequential data, such as structured
  Electronic Health Records (EHRs), efficiently. We introduce three pretext tasks
  for pre-training the Transformer model, utilizing large amounts of unlabeled structured
  EHR data, followed by fine-tuning on downstream prediction tasks using the limited
  labeled data. Through extensive experiments on three real-world health datasets,
  we demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark
  clinical tasks, including in-hospital mortality classification, phenotyping, and
  length-of-stay prediction. Our findings highlight the efficacy of in effectively
  addressing the challenges associated with clinical time series data, thus contributing
  to advancements in healthcare analytics.'
