title: 'MULTIPAR: Supervised Irregular Tensor Factorization with Multi-task Learning
  for Computational Phenotyping'
abstract: 'Tensor factorization has received increasing interest due to its intrinsic
  ability to capture latent factors in multi-dimensional data with many applications
  including Electronic Health Records (EHR) mining. PARAFAC2 and its variants have
  been proposed to address irregular tensors where one of the tensor modes is not
  aligned, e.g., different patients in EHRs may have different length of records.
  PARAFAC2 has been successfully applied to EHRs for extracting meaningful medical
  concepts (phenotypes). Despite recent advancements, current modelsâ€™ predictability
  and interpretability are not satisfactory, which limits its utility for downstream
  analysis. In this paper, we propose MULTIPAR: a supervised irregular tensor factorization
  with multi-task learning for computational phenotyping. MULTIPAR is flexible to
  incorporate both static (e.g. in-hospital mortality prediction) and continuous or
  dynamic (e.g. the need for ventilation) tasks. By supervising the tensor factorization
  with downstream prediction tasks and leveraging information from multiple related
  predictive tasks, MULTIPAR can yield not only more meaningful phenotypes but also
  better predictive performance for downstream tasks. We conduct extensive experiments
  on two real-world temporal EHR datasets to demonstrate that MULTIPAR is scalable
  and achieves better tensor fit with more meaningful subgroups and stronger predictive
  performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. The implementation of
  MULTIPAR is available https://github.com/yifeiren13/MULTIPAR .'
