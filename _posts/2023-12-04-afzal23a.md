title: 'Towards Equitable Kidney Tumor Segmentation: Bias Evaluation and Mitigation'
abstract: Kidney tumors, affecting over 400,000 individuals annually, require accurate
  segmentation for effective treatment and surgical planning. Yet, manual segmentation
  is time-consuming, steering the medical community towards automated methods. While
  computer-aided diagnostic tools promise improvements, their transition into the
  real world mandates an understanding of their performance across diverse population
  subgroups. Our study is the first to investigate fairness concerning kidney and
  tumor segmentation, particularly focusing on sensitive attributes like sex and age.
  Our findings show an existence of bias in performance across both attributes. In
  particular, despite a male-dominated training dataset, females showed superior segmentation
  performance. Age groups 60-70 and above 70 also deviated significantly from the
  average performance for all ages. To address these biases, we comprehensively explore
  bias mitigation strategies - encompassing pre-processing techniques (Resampling
  Algorithm and Stratified Batch Sampling) and in-processing methods (Fair Meta-learning
  and architectural adjustments). Specifically, Attention U-Net was identified as
  the optimal model for balancing fairness across both attributes while maintaining
  high segmentation performance. We present a crucial insight that the architecture
  itself could be a source of inherent biases, and careful selection of the network
  design can inherently reduce these biases. Our assessment of UNet variants challenges
  the prevailing paradigm of model selection predicated solely on segmentation performance,
  especially considering the profound implications biases can have in clinical outcomes.
