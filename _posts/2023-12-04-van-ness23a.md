title: Interpretable Survival Analysis for Heart Failure Risk Prediction
abstract: Survival analysis, or time-to-event analysis, is an important and widespread
  problem in healthcare research. Medical research has traditionally relied on Cox
  models for survival analysis, due to their simplicity and interpretability. Cox
  models assume a log-linear hazard function as well as proportional hazards over
  time, and can perform poorly when these assumptions fail. Newer survival models
  based on machine learning avoid these assumptions and offer improved accuracy, yet
  sometimes at the expense of model interpretability, which is vital for clinical
  use. We propose a novel survival analysis pipeline that is both interpretable and
  competitive with state-of-the-art survival models. Specifically, we use an improved
  version of survival stacking to transform a survival analysis problem to a classification
  problem, ControlBurn to perform feature selection, and Explainable Boosting Machines
  to generate interpretable predictions. To evaluate our pipeline, we predict risk
  of heart failure using a large-scale EHR database. Our pipeline achieves state-of-the-art
  performance and provides interesting and novel insights about risk factors for heart
  failure.
