title: How Fair are Medical Imaging Foundation Models?
abstract: 'While medical imaging foundation models have led to significant improvements
  across various tasks, the pivotal issue of subgroup fairness in these foundation
  models has remained largely unexplored. Our work bridges this research gap by presenting
  the first comprehensive study analyzing the subgroup fairness of six diverse foundation
  models, encompassing various pre-training methods, sources of pre-training data,
  and model architectures. In doing so, we discover a concerning trade-off: foundation
  models pre-trained on medical images achieve better overall performance but are
  consistently less fair than those pre-trained on natural images, with sometimes
  even worse fairness than baseline models trained from scratch. To mitigate these
  fairness disparities, we show that augmenting both the volume of pre-training data
  as well as the number of pre-training epochs, enhances subgroup fairness of medical
  imaging pre-trained models. Furthermore, to decouple the fairness bias from the
  pre-training and fine-tuning stages, we employ balanced datasets for fine-tuning.
  While fine-tuning on balanced datasets partially mitigates fairness issues, it is
  insufficient to completely eliminate the biases from the pre-training stage, prompting
  the need for careful design and evaluation of medical imaging foundation models.
  Our granular analysis reveals that medical imaging pre-trained models tend to favor
  majority racial subgroups (White, Asian) whereas natural imaging pre-trained models
  tend to favor minority racial subgroups (Black). Additionally, across all foundation
  models, we observe a consistent underperformance on the female patients cohort.
  As the community moves towards designing specialized foundation models for medical
  imaging, we hope our timely research provides crucial insights to help inform more
  equitable model development.'
