title: Interpretable Mechanistic Representations for Meal-level Glycemic Control in
  the Wild
abstract: Diabetes encompasses a complex landscape of glycemic control that varies
  widely among individuals. However, current methods do not faithfully capture this
  variability at the meal level. On the one hand, expert-crafted features lack the
  flexibility of data-driven methods; on the other hand, learned representations tend
  to be uninterpretable which hampers clinical adoption. In this paper, we propose
  a hybrid variational autoencoder to learn interpretable representations of CGM and
  meal data. Our method grounds the latent space to the inputs of a mechanistic differential
  equation, producing embeddings that reflect physiological quantities, such as insulin
  sensitivity, glucose effectiveness, and basal glucose levels. Moreover, we introduce
  a novel method to infer the glucose appearance rate, making the mechanistic model
  robust to unreliable meal logs. On a dataset of CGM and self-reported meals from
  individuals with type-2 diabetes and pre-diabetes, our unsupervised representation
  discovers a separation between individuals proportional to their disease severity.
  Our embeddings produce clusters that are up to 4x better than naive, expert, black-box,
  and pure mechanistic features. Our method provides a nuanced, yet interpretable,
  embedding space to compare glycemic control within and across individuals, directly
  learnable from in-the-wild data.
