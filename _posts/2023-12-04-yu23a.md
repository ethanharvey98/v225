title: Dynamic Interpretable Change Point Detection for Physiological Data Analysis
abstract: Identifying change points (CPs) in time series is crucial to guide better
  decision-making in healthcare, and facilitating timely responses to potential risks
  or opportunities. In maternal health, monitoring health signals in pregnant women
  allows healthcare providers to promptly respond to complications like preeclampsia
  or enhance delivery time detection, improving overall maternal care. Existing Change
  Point Detection (CPD) methods often fail to generalize effectively due to diverse
  underlying changes that can cause a CP. We propose Ti me Va rying CPD (TiVaCPD),
  a change point detection method that captures different types of changes in the
  underlying distribution of multidimensional data. It combines a dynamic window MMD
  test with a graphical Lasso estimator of feature covariance to measure both changes
  in the joint distribution of the observations as well as changes in feature dynamics.
  TiVaCPD generates a unifying CP score by evaluating the relative similarity of the
  statistical tests. Additionally, TiVaCPD score enhances interpretability by offering
  insight into the underlying causes of CPs through a detailed analysis of feature
  dynamics, which is especially valuable in healthcare applications. We evaluate the
  performance of TiVaCPD on both simulated and real-world data, showing that it can
  outperform state-of-the-art methods. We further demonstrate the appliance of TiVaCPD
  in a pregnancy-related case study, showcasing the joint shifts in physiological
  signals that facilitate the detection of delivery time.
