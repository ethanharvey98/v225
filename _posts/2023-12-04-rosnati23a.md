title: Robust semi-supervised segmentation with timestep ensembling diffusion models
abstract: Medical image segmentation is a challenging task, made more difficult by
  many datasets’ limited size and annotations. Denoising diffusion probabilistic models
  (DDPM) have recently shown promise in modelling the distribution of natural images
  and were successfully applied to various medical imaging tasks. This work focuses
  on semi-supervised image segmentation using diffusion models, particularly addressing
  domain generalisation. Firstly, we demonstrate that smaller diffusion steps generate
  latent representations that are more robust for downstream tasks than larger steps.
  Secondly, we use this insight to propose an improved ensembling scheme that leverages
  information-dense small steps and the regularising effect of larger steps to generate
  predictions. Our model shows significantly better performance in domain-shifted
  settings while retaining competitive performance in-domain. Overall, this work highlights
  the potential of DDPMs for semi-supervised medical image segmentation and provides
  insights into optimising their performance under domain shift.
