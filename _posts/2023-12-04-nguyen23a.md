title: Pragmatic Radiology Report Generation
abstract: When pneumonia is not found on a chest X-ray, should the report describe
  this negative observation or omit it? We argue that this question cannot be answered
  from the X-ray alone and requires a pragmatic perspective, which captures the communicative
  goal that radiology reports serve between radiologists and patients. However, the
  standard image-to-text formulation for radiology report generation fails to incorporate
  such pragmatic intents. Following this pragmatic perspective, we demonstrate that
  the indication, which describes why a patient comes for an X-ray, drives the mentions
  of negative observations. We thus introduce indications as additional input to report
  generation. With respect to the output, we develop a framework to identify uninferable
  information from the image, which could be a source of model hallucinations, and
  limit them by cleaning groundtruth reports. Finally, we use indications and cleaned
  groundtruth reports to develop pragmatic models, and show that they outperform existing
  methods not only in new pragmatics-inspired metrics (e.g., +4.3 Negative F1) but
  also in standard metrics (e.g., +6.3 Positive F1 and +11.0 BLEU-2).
