title: Supervised Electrocardiogram(ECG) Features Outperform Knowledge-based And Unsupervised
  Features In Individualized Survival Prediction
abstract: An electrocardiogram (ECG) provides crucial information about an individual’s
  health status. Researchers utilize ECG data to develop learners for a variety of
  tasks, ranging from diagnosing ECG abnormalities to estimating time to death – here
  modeled as individual survival distributions (ISDs). The way the ECG is represented
  is important for creating an effective learner. While many traditional ECG-based
  prediction models rely on hand-crafted features, such as heart rate, this study
  aims to achieve a better representation. The effectiveness of various ECG based
  feature extraction methods for prediction of ISDs, either supervised or unsupervised,
  have not been explored previously. The study uses a large ECG dataset from 244,077
  patients with over 1.6 million 12-lead ECGs, each labeled with the patient{’}s disease
  {–} one or more International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes. We explored
  extracting high-level features from ECG traces using various approaches, then trained
  models that used these ECG features (along with age and sex), across a range of
  training sizes, to estimate patient-specific ISDs. The results showed that the supervised
  feature extractor method produced ECG features that can estimate ISD curves better
  than ECG features obtained from unsupervised or knowledge-based methods. Supervised
  ECG features required fewer training instances (as low as 500) to learn ISD models
  that performed better than the baseline model that only used age and sex. On the
  other hand, unsupervised and knowledge-based ECG features required over 5,000 training
  samples to produce ISD models that performed better than the baseline. The study’s
  findings may assist researchers in selecting the most appropriate approach for extracting
  high-level features from ECG signals to estimate patient-specific ISD curves.
