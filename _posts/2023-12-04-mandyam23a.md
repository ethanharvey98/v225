title: Compositional Q-learning for electrolyte repletion with imbalanced patient
  sub-populations
abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is an effective framework for solving sequential
  decision-making tasks. However, applying RL methods in medical care settings is
  challenging in part due to heterogeneity in treatment response among patients. Some
  patients can be treated with standard protocols whereas others, such as those with
  chronic diseases, need personalized treatment planning. Traditional RL methods often
  fail to account for this heterogeneity, because they assume that all patients respond
  to the treatment in the same way (i.e., transition dynamics are shared). We introduce
  Compositional Fitted Q -iteration (CFQI), which uses a compositional task structure
  to represent heterogeneous treatment responses in medical care settings. A compositional
  task consists of several variations of the same task, each progressing in difficulty;
  solving simpler variants of the task can enable efficient solving of harder variants.
  CFQI uses a compositional Q -value function with separate modules for each task
  variant, allowing it to take advantage of shared knowledge while learning distinct
  policies for each variant. We validate CFQIâ€™s performance using a Cartpole environment
  and use CFQI to recommend electrolyte repletion for patients with and without renal
  disease. Our results demonstrate that CFQI is robust even in the presence of class
  imbalance, enabling effective information usage across patient sub-populations.
  CFQI exhibits great promise for clinical applications in scenarios characterized
  by known compositional structures.
