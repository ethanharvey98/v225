title: Zero-Shot ECG Diagnosis with Large Language Models and Retrieval-Augmented
  Generation
abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become essential players in
  the deep learning domain. While their capabilities are evident across various textual
  tasks, this study aims to bridge the gap and explore the potential of leveraging
  LLMs in diagnosing cardiac diseases and sleep apnea from Electrocardiography (ECG).
  Earlier work touched on converting ECG signals into text for LLMs, but a comprehensive
  LLM-based approach for dealing with more complicated symptoms remains relatively
  unexplored. To investigate the ECG diagnosis with an LLM-based approach, our research
  introduces a zero-shot retrieval-augmented diagnosis technique. We have built databases
  filled with specific domain knowledge for cardiac symptom and sleep apnea diagnosis,
  which encourages the LLMs from merely relying on the inherent LLM knowledge to a
  more holistic pipeline from carefully crafting prompts and infusing expert knowledge
  to guide LLMs. We evaluate the proposed approach on two datasets for diagnosing
  arrhythmia and sleep apnea, respectively. The evaluation results indicate that our
  zero-shot approach not only surpasses previous few-shot LLM-based methods but is
  also competitive with supervised learning techniques fully trained on extensive
  datasets.
