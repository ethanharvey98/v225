title: On the Importance of Step-wise Embeddings for Heterogeneous Clinical Time-Series
abstract: Recent advances in deep learning architectures for sequence modeling have
  not fully transferred to tasks handling time-series from electronic health records.
  In particular, in problems related to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), the state-of-the-art
  remains to tackle sequence classification in a tabular manner with tree-based methods.
  Recent findings in deep learning for tabular data are now surpassing these classical
  methods by better handling the severe heterogeneity of data input features. Given
  the similar level of feature heterogeneity exhibited by ICU time-series and motivated
  by these findings, we explore these novel methods’ impact on clinical sequence modeling
  tasks. By jointly using such advances in deep learning for tabular data, our primary
  objective is to underscore the importance of step-wise embeddings in time-series
  modeling, which remain unexplored in machine learning methods for clinical data.
  On a variety of clinically relevant tasks from two large-scale ICU datasets, MIMIC-III
  and HiRID, our work provides an exhaustive analysis of state-of-the-art methods
  for tabular time-series as time-step embedding models, showing overall performance
  improvement. In particular, we evidence the importance of feature grouping in clinical
  time-series, with significant performance gains when considering features within
  predefined semantic groups in the step-wise embedding module.
