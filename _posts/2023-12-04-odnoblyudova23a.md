title: Nonparametric modeling of the composite effect of multiple nutrients on blood
  glucose dynamics
abstract: In biomedical applications it is often necessary to estimate a physiological
  response to a treatment consisting of multiple components, and learn the separate
  effects of the components in addition to the joint effect. Here, we extend existing
  probabilistic nonparametric approaches to explicitly address this problem. We also
  develop a new convolution-based model for composite treatment–response curves that
  is more biologically interpretable. We validate our models by estimating the impact
  of carbohydrate and fat in meals on blood glucose. By differentiating treatment
  components, incorporating their dosages, and sharing statistical information across
  patients via a hierarchical multi-output Gaussian process, our method improves prediction
  accuracy over existing approaches, and allows us to interpret the different effects
  of carbohydrates and fat on the overall glucose response.
