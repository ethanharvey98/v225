title: 'NoteContrast: Contrastive Language-Diagnostic Pretraining for Medical Text'
abstract: Accurate diagnostic coding of medical notes is crucial for enhancing patient
  care, medical research, and error-free billing in healthcare organizations. Manual
  coding is a time-consuming task for providers, and diagnostic codes often exhibit
  low sensitivity and specificity, whereas the free text in medical notes can be a
  more precise description of a patientâ€™s status. Thus, accurate automated diagnostic
  coding of medical notes has become critical for a learning healthcare system. Recent
  developments in long-document transformer architectures have enabled attention-based
  deep-learning models to adjudicate medical notes. In addition, contrastive loss
  functions have been used to jointly pre-train large language and image models with
  noisy labels. To further improve the automated adjudication of medical notes, we
  developed an approach based on i) models for ICD-10 diagnostic code sequences using
  a large real-world data set, ii) large language models for medical notes, and iii)
  contrastive pre-training to build an integrated model of both ICD-10 diagnostic
  codes and corresponding medical text. We demonstrate that a contrastive approach
  for pre-training improves performance over prior state-of-the-art models for the
  MIMIC-III-50, MIMIC-III-rare50, and MIMIC-III-full diagnostic coding tasks.
