title: Towards Reliable Dermatology Evaluation Benchmarks
abstract: Benchmark datasets for digital dermatology unwittingly contain inaccuracies
  that reduce trust in model performance estimates. We propose a resource-efficient
  data-cleaning protocol to identify issues that escaped previous curation. The protocol
  leverages an existing algorithmic cleaning strategy and is followed by a confirmation
  process terminated by an intuitive stopping criterion. Based on confirmation by
  multiple dermatologists, we remove irrelevant samples and near duplicates and estimate
  the percentage of label errors in six dermatology image datasets for model evaluation
  promoted by the isic . Along with this paper, we publish revised file lists for
  each dataset which should be used for model evaluation. https://github.com/Digital-Dermatology/SelfClean-Revised-Benchmarks
  Our work paves the way for more trustworthy performance assessment in digital dermatology.
