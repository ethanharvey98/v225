title: Automated Cardiovascular Record Retrieval by Multimodal Learning between Electrocardiogram
  and Clinical Report
abstract: 'Automated interpretation of electrocardiograms (ECG) has garnered significant
  attention with the advancements in machine learning methodologies. Despite the growing
  interest, most current studies focus solely on classification or regression tasks
  which overlook a crucial aspect of clinical cardio-disease diagnosis: the diagnostic
  report generated by experienced human clinicians. In this paper, we introduce a
  novel approach to ECG interpretation, leveraging recent breakthroughs in Large Language
  Models (LLMs) and Vision-Transformer (ViT) models. Rather than treating ECG diagnosis
  as a classification or regression task, we propose an alternative method of automatically
  identifying the most similar clinical cases based on the input ECG data. Also, since
  interpreting ECG as images is more affordable and accessible, we process ECG as
  encoded images and adopt a vision-language learning paradigm to jointly learn vision-language
  alignment between encoded ECG images and ECG diagnosis reports. Encoding ECG into
  images can result in an efficient ECG retrieval system, which will be highly practical
  and useful in clinical applications. More importantly, our findings could serve
  as a crucial resource for providing diagnostic services in underdevelopment regions.'
